# RESULTS directory

This directory will contain results of the simulations, both data and figures (if any).
Outputs of the simulation are stored in a new folder; three files are created:

- `beetles_*.Rds` stores the beetle population sizes in all trees at each week of the simulation.

- `tree_states_*.Rds` stores the status of trees at each year of the simulation.

- `ic.Rds`is the initial condition used for the simulation.


We did not package such results in the repository, so this file is here only to ensure that the directory is generated when you clone the repository.
