# DED-Ecological-Modelling-code
This repository contains R code for a paper by Bajeux, Arino, Portet and Westwood, published in Ecological Modelling in 2020. The code here does not cover the entirety of the content of the paper. In particular, we do not provide specific code to generate all the figures in the paper, although they can easily be generated using the code here.

## Important
Some of the code requires substantial computing power (multiple cores) or RAM (>128 GB). This will be indicated in the function description below.
